Brings back Color Coding in the Outlining for VB.NET

![Brings back Color Coding in the Outlining for VB.NET](/VB Outliner/VB Outliner.jpg?raw=true "Brings back Color Coding in the Outlining for VB.NET")

## Disclaimer
I've been missing this feature since VS2008 I think, so I decided to make something.
It is my first Extension for Visual Studio. It was originally programmed for VS2013, but I adapted it to 2015.

This project is in **BETA** and some elements doesn't work properly, but I already use it in my workflow.
**PLEASE CONTINUOUSLY SAVE YOUR WORK IF YOU USE THIS EXTENSION, IT MIGHT UNEXPECTEDLY CRASH**

*I do not intend to develop this project further, as my knowledge in VS Extensions is really limited.
Feel free to propose updates to make it better for everyone.*

## Informations
I didn't know how to change the Default Outlining, so I created a new Outlining on top of the existing one.

## Known Issues
* Visual Studio might crash in unexpected cases. I added a lot of Try Catch, but it might still happen.
* The highliting of User Types (Classes, Interfaces, Modules, etc. ) is not working in VS2015
* The Tooltip might not come as expected (location or text)
* The Tooltip is displaying white text, even is VS2015 is normally displaying colored Tooltips. *I do not know how to make it colored*
